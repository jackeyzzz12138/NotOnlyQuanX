# ~~QX~~ Loon Scripts for ***own use***  

## Introduction
Due to the @RuCu6 delete the original repository, and in order to keep the AD block scripts working properly. So build this new repository.

These have been tested:
- [x] ~~wepage.conf~~(not work anymore)
- [x] dongqiudi.plugin
- [] zhengqi.plugin

## TODO

Now, it contains not only scripts but also numerous [proxy profiles](./Profile/), which are for personal use and have been slightly modified based on other authors' profiles. If I forget to write your ID in contribution, please feel free to email me.

supported platforms(To be continued):

- surge (mac)
- shadowrocket
- QuanX
- Loon
- clash verge rev
- mihomo party
- ~~clash for windows~~

## Q&A
- Q: Will you be responsible for the updates after this incident?  
  A: Maybe.

- Q: Could I make a request?  
  A: Sure, you can, It's your right.

- Q: Why only has this script/rewrite, not others?  
  A: ~~Because I don't need that.~~ Now, It has the profiles.ðŸ˜Š
